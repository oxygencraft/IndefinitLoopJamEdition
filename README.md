# Indefinit(Loop);

A 2D top down puzzle game

# Game Info

You are a robot who is stuck in a code loop. You must break the loop by executing a break statement.

You must execute the code exactly as specified by the programmer (level designer). There are several different types of code statements,
all from real programming languages and doing different actions (some actions may not actually reflect what happens in real programming
languages). If you deviate from the code, you will be surrounded by continue statements and fail the level.

One of the statements is function statement. This statement is a block of code can can perform any action. For example, it can trigger
an environment object to perform an action.

Environment objects are objects that can interact with the world and other objects. One object is a pusher, it can push objects in the 
direction it is facing or in all four directions. Objects can be manipulated with so use this to your advantage to complete the level.

(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

The programmer has made mistakes with the code and as a result, deviations from the code at certain points is allowed. You can use this
to your advantage to complete the level.
