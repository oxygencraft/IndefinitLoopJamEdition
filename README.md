# Indefinit(Loop);

A 2d top down puzzle game

You're stuck in a loop in code and you need to misbehave to create an exception in the program and stop the loop.
The code is a 2d top down puzzle level where statements are scattered over the level.

You must perform (execute) the code by interacting with the statements world. For example you pick up values to assign your variables and you can call functions by going to them.

(Jam version does not deviations yet but this but will implement post jam)

~~You must perform the loop exactly but the programmer (level designer) has made some mistakes and allowed the code to do things differently at some points. If you deviate from the code when you are not permitted, you will be surrounded by continue statements and fail the level.~~

Environment objects are objects that manipulate other objects in the world. You can interact with environment objects by calling the function that interacts with environment objects.

Blocks are objects that are in the way and do nothing. You can move the environment objects and blocks around so use that to your advantage to complete the level.

To exit the level, you must execute a break statement. If you execute a continue statement, you fail the level and will restart the level
